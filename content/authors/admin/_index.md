I am a graduate student at the Robotics Institute, Carnegie Mellon University (CMU). I am interested in working at the intersection of machine learning (ML) and robotics.

<!-- I worked as a Research Associate at [Prof Howie Choset\'s](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/ri-faculty/howie-choset/) [Biorobotics Lab](http://biorobotics.ri.cmu.edu/) on two directions in reinforcement learning (RL). The former is skill learning - an intersection of model-based and model-free RL in a hierarchical / options setup. The latter involves developing exploration strategies for learning robot locomotion policies.

Before joining CMU, I worked as a Research Associate at [Prof Howie Choset\'s](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~choset/) Biorobotics Lab on [skill learning](./project/skill-learning) and [snake robots.](./project/snake-robot) During my undergrad, I spent time working at [Dr. Shital Chiddarwar\'s](http://mec.vnit.ac.in/people/sschiddarwar/) [IvLabs,](http://www.ivlabs.in/) building a [stair climbing](./publication/stair_climbing) robot and an [assistive](./publication/person_follower) robot. I spent the summer of 2020 working in [Dr. David Held\'s](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/ri-faculty/david-held/) [R-PAD Lab](https://r-pad.github.io/) as a part of the Robotics Institute Summer Scholar's Program remotely.

Besides research, I enjoy music, biking, and spending time in nature.

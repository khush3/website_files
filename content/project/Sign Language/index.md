### Abstract
Description Sign languages are languages that use the visual-manual modality to convey meaning. Sign languages are expressed through manual articulations in combination with non-manual elements. Sign languages are full-fledged natural languages with their own grammar and lexicon. Unlike acoustically conveyed sound patterns, sign language uses body language and manual communication to fluently convey the thoughts of a person. It is achieved by simultaneously combining hand shapes, orientation and movement of the hands, arms or body, and facial expressions. This way of communication is however limited to a group of people, which introduces a communication barrier. The need for a interpreter is essential to tackle this problem. A possible approach is using computer vision and machine learning techniques. This approach can, however, be costly and needs a bulky hardware setup or special application installation. Also, it is subject to lighting condition and perspective problems. We devised a cost-effective and easy-to-use glove that can overcome these limitations and act as a interpreter flawlessly.
